# PyGame Dungeon Crawler

A multi-part learning project for building a simple dungeon crawler with PyGame.
Each `Part` folder contains a self-contained snapshot of the game at that stage.

## Running

Pick a part and run its main file:

```bash
cd "Part 1"
python main.py
```

(Repeat with `Part 2`, `Part 3`, etc. as desired.)
