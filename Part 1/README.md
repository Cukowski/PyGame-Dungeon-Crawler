# Dungeon Crawler Game - Part 1

This repository contains the code for **Part 1** of the Dungeon Crawler game tutorial series using **Python** and **Pygame**.

## Overview
In this first part, we set up the foundation of our dungeon crawler game. The focus is on creating a game window, adding a playable character, and implementing basic movement mechanics.

### Features
- Game window creation with customizable dimensions and background color.
- Playable character with smooth movement mechanics.
- Keyboard input handling for directional movements (up, down, left, right).
- Game loop structure for updating and rendering the game.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pygame (latest version)

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd DungeonCrawler_Part1
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```

4. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## File Structure
- `main.py`: Contains the main game loop and handles character movement.
- `constants.py`: Stores game constants like screen dimensions, colors, and FPS settings.
- `character.py`: Defines the `Character` class for the player.

## Controls
- **Arrow Keys**: Move the character up, down, left, or right.

## Next Steps
In the next part, we will:
- Add animations for the player character.
- Implement basic collision detection.
- Introduce an interactive dungeon environment.
